The data is then stored in a PostgreSQL database through the psycopg2 library. The app was fully containerized using Docker, allowing deployment on any environment. A minimal HTML interface was created for file upload testing without using external tools like Postman. RESTful endpoints were defined for both upload and metadata retrieval. This project enhanced understanding of non-blocking I/O, database integration, and DevOps tools like Docker."
